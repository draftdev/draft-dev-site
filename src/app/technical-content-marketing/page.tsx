        <p>Content marketing has proven time and time again that it can be a valuable revenue driver for businesses, regardless of industry. While many businesses know the value of content marketing, they struggle to turn content into a consistent, predictable growth channel. All too often, they start a blog, create a few posts, then lose steam. The marketing team looks back at their Analytics account a few weeks later and sees almost nothing, so they move on to other channels.
          This challenge is magnified in the AI era, where Google's AI Overviews and other AI search features now intercept up to 60% or more of search traffic through zero-click results. For technical content marketing, this impact is even greater, with informational queries seeing up to a 34.5% drop in click-through rates when AI Overviews appear. Despite these challenges, content marketing remains essential—it simply requires adaptation to this new reality.
          <br /><br />Here, we walk you through the pre-requisites and goals of building an effective content marketing engine for technical audiences: The tech stack, strategy, and a tried and trusted framework to help you reverse engineer your production and publishing plan. We also address the specific challenges of creating technical content in an era where AI systems increasingly mediate the relationship between your content and your audience.<br /><br />We then will teach you about the content funnel, different funnel stages and their purposes, and how to create a productive content mix.
          We walk through the prerequisites of building a strong content marketing engine. We will walk through what to measure, how to measure it, and why, as well as explaining how we want to attract awareness, capture traffic, and turn it into leads. It provides helpful foundational knowledge for everything you learn in this book. At the end of this eBook you'll know how to create interconnected content systems that establish authority, drive organic traffic, and generate qualified leads from technical audiences.

          The Complete Technical Content Marketing Guide: From Lead Generation to Revenue Growth in the AI Era
        </h2>
        <p>
          As content marketers, we have a responsibility to the business to provide predictable output of content that drives people from awareness to consideration to purchase decision. We also have a duty to analyze and report on what we do and why we do it, and to learn and revise our actions based on these insights. Marketing in general, but <strong>content marketing specifically, is not an art; it's a science</strong>. It takes robust systems, processes, and discipline to execute.<br /><strong>Marketers who fail to succeed at content marketing usually either lack the processes, systems, and frameworks needed, or they lack the discipline to carry out those processes consistently.</strong><br />
          In today's AI-dominated landscape, our responsibility extends beyond driving website traffic. Technical B2B marketers must now optimize for "content influence" - ensuring our expertise is recognized and cited by AI systems that increasingly mediate how developers and technical professionals discover information. This requires intentional optimization for both traditional search and emerging AI discovery patterns.
          <br /><br />
          This page will walk you through the exact process that you can use to set up a predictable, consistent content engine that provides you with insights and data to <strong>prove its effectiveness to business leadership.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          A <strong>“content marketing engine”</strong> is a repeatable system for creating, publishing, and promoting content designed to reach and convert your target customers.
          Each piece of content is aimed at a specific stage of the marketing funnel (awareness, consideration, decision) and should lead to predictable and measurable results for your business. The desired results are typically traffic generation and new leads added to your database.
          <br /><br />
          In the AI era, we must expand these results to include AI Overview appearances, brand citation rates, and technical authority metrics that measure how frequently your content is referenced by AI systems. What's changed is not the fundamental value of content marketing, but how we must adapt our approach for an environment where AI systems like Google's AI Overviews now mediate information discovery and consumption.
          Here, we'll focus on written content in the form of blog posts as the primary medium for your content engine. While you don't have to limit your content engine to written content, writing is often the best place to start. <strong>Blog posts can be easily repurposed</strong> into downloadable PDFs, conversations for a podcast, or talks for a conference.
          Technical content particularly benefits from this approach, as code examples, technical documentation, and implementation guides <strong>can be strategically structured to maintain value in both AI-summarized and full-length formats.</strong>
          We know this strategy works because we've used it for years, implementing it for companies of all sizes. Whether you're a one-person marketing team with less than $1 million in annual revenue or part of a multi-million-dollar software company, follow along with this eBook to create a repeatable, scalable, and predictable content marketing engine!
          <br /><br />
          In the following sections, we'll show you how to set up a predictable and scalable content marketing framework - step by step.
          First, we'll cover setting up core pre-requisites like your content management system and analytics tracking. Next, we'll show you how to turn anonymous traffic into known leads that you store in your database and increase brand awareness using retargeting.
          Finally, we'll show you how to set up and use a content calendar to ensure that your content engine is consistent and predictable.

        <h3 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 lg:text-3xl">Setting up a Content Management System</h3>
        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          Content pieces published per month.<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          You need to reliably publish content in order to attract new people to your site.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          Team members can easily create, preview, and publish content on your site.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Set up your blog using a static site generator and a headless CMS</h4>
        <p>
          Using a <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generator</a> and <a href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/">headless CMS</a> for your blog will eliminate most of your speed and security problems. They make it easy to publish new content, add code snippets (like retargeting and analytics), update your stylesheets, and customize everything about your site. For technical content marketing in the AI era, these systems offer additional advantages: they allow more granular control over content structure, metadata, and schema markup, all critical factors in how AI systems process your content. Implementing proper heading hierarchies, structured data for code samples, and clear technical documentation patterns improves how AI systems parse and cite your expertise.<br />
          Of course, you can choose to use different solutions (<a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, for example) to set up your Content Engine. These solutions work fine, but we typically recommend <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/next-js/overview/">Next.js and Netlify</a>. This setup can be hosted for free using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and the ongoing maintenance is much lower than server-side solutions like WordPress.<br />
          These solutions also come with a lot of “ready-to-use” features that make performance optimization and tracking capabilities very easy to set up. Having these in place will ensure that your site adheres to Google's <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Web Vitals</a> and will lead to better search engine rankings in the long run. Additionally, this architecture makes it easier to implement AI-readable content structures, including explicit answer sections, FAQ schema, and table-based information that AI systems can effectively extract and cite.
        </p>
        <h4>What if I already have a blog set up on my domain?</h4>
        <p>
          Don't reinvent the wheel. If your CMS works for you and it performs well, there's no need to spend a month migrating to a static site. Website migrations can be very delicate, so consult with your engineering team or an external specialist before you start this process.<br />
          If, on the other hand, your CMS is restricting the amount of content you can produce or its poor performance is hurting your ability to rank well in search engines, you should move off it as soon as possible. In the AI era, <strong>technical content needs particular attention</strong> to structure and machine readability. If your current CMS limits your ability to implement structured data, create properly nested heading hierarchies, or control the semantics of your HTML, consider prioritizing migration. These technical elements significantly impact how AI systems process and cite your content - potentially affecting 60% of your potential audience who now consume content through AI interfaces.<br />
          One decision you will face then is whether you'd like your blog to be located on a subdirectory (/blog) or on a subdomain (blog.yourdomain.com). There are different viable approaches, depending on the role your blog plays for your business. But, if you'd like to implement the systems taught throughout our Draft.dev resources, our <strong>clear recommendation</strong> is to have your blog located in a subdirectory on your top-level-domain. The reason being that, over time, your published blog content will receive backlinks from external sources and we'd rather have them benefit our top-level-domain than a subdomain.<br />
          Search Engines “see” subdomains as separate entities. So, if we'd receive a lot of backlinks to our subdomain, we'd then have to generate a lot of backlinks to our top-level-domain <strong>from our blog subdomain</strong>. Which means we'd have to link to our “main website” as often as possible from our own blog. Which, depending on the type of content we have published, can make sense in a lot of cases, but won't make sense 100% of the time and might be perceived as very pushy. <br />
          This subdirectory approach becomes even more important in the AI era where domain authority and topical authority influence how AI systems evaluate the credibility of your content. By keeping technical content on your main domain, you consolidate authority signals that help both traditional SEO and AI citation metrics.
        </p>
        <h4>What about publishing on Medium, Dev.to or LinkedIn?</h4>
        <p>
          Publishing your blog posts exclusively to a third-party platform like Medium, Dev.to, or LinkedIn is tempting because it’s easy, and they offer a built-in distribution network. In the age of AI Overviews and zero-click content consumption it’s also a good approach to establish a multi-platform presence as to not having to solely rely on your website for brand awareness.<br />
          <strong>That said, especially at the beginning of your content marketing journey it is not a good idea as they won’t help your primary top-level-domain’s ranking in search engines.</strong> Links on these platforms are usually <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links">“no-follow links,”</a> so they won’t pass much value to other resources or landing pages you reference from them. Once you have your content engine running, you can use publishing on these platforms as opportunities to syndicate optimized versions with canonical links back to your site. For technical content marketing, platforms like Dev.to should be viewed as citation opportunities rather than traffic drivers – places where your expertise can be recognized by AI systems and developer communities alike.<br />
          If you already have content on these platforms, I recommend migrating it to your new blog and updating existing platform content with <strong>canonical links pointing to your domain version</strong> and to restructure it to serve as a "preview" that drives users to the complete resource on your site. We will talk much more in detail about content syndication on platforms like Dev.to or Medium later on this page.
        </p>
         <h3 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 lg:text-3xl">Setting up and Using Analytics</h3>
        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          Unique visitors per month, average time on page, citations in AI overviews<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          Analytics give you insights into your audience and tell you how many unique readers your blog posts get, how long those readers are on your site, and where they are based.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          Your team can track traffic and user engagement driven by your content marketing efforts. This will help you make meaningful decisions about future content production.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Set up Google Analytics</h4>
        <p>
          By far, the most common option for site analytics is <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a>. It’s not necessarily the easiest to use, but it’s powerful, free, and widely documented. If you’re using Next.js, <a href="https://dev.to/rajeshkumaryadavdotcom/how-to-implement-google-analytics-4-ga4-in-a-nextjs-project-dm7">here is a follow-along tutorial</a> to set it up. If not, here is the detailed <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/14088998?hl=en&ref_topic=14090456&sjid=8415351136047686406-US">Google Analytics documentation</a>.<br />
          Alternatively, you can set up your Google Analytics script using the <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/14842164">Google TAG Manager</a> (GTM). GTM allows for automatic asynchronous loading of scripts, which is helpful for optimizing page load speed metrics like the <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">largest contentful paint</a>, but it’s more complicated to set up. You can <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/features/">see a list of TAG manager features here</a> to decide if it’s worth the investment when you’re getting started.<br />
          While Google Analytics remains essential, it's now insufficient for measuring technical content performance in the AI era. Consider complementing it with tools that track AI Overview appearances (for example <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">ahrefs</a>), brand mentions in search features, and crawler traffic from AI systems. If you want to get very granular, you can also add custom Google Tag Manager events to track when users engage with more advanced technical elements like code examples, API documentation, or interactive tools – behaviors that signal higher intent in technical audiences.<br />
          We also recommend setting up Google Search Console to get insights into organic search impression trends. 
        </p>
        <h4>
          Track unique visitors
        </h4>
        <p>
          Over time, you obviously want the number of unique visitors to your site to rise. When you publish and promote a new piece of content, you’ll likely see a spike in traffic from social media and newsletters, but “organic” search engine traffic from specific keyword searches will drive much more traffic in the long term. In Google Analytics, you will want to keep track of the “Active Users” metric to get an overview of how many unique visitors were visiting your site. <br />

          TODO: IMPLEMENT Google_Analytics_Dashboard_Active_Users pic
          <br />
          In the AI era, you can focus on segmenting your traffic analysis to distinguish between different types of visitors. Particularly for technical content, track developer-specific metrics like code sample usage, documentation page depth, API interaction, GitHub referrals, and repeat visitor patterns. These signals help identify high-intent technical visitors despite lower overall traffic volumes.<br />

          It’s hard to set realistic goals for the “unique visitors” metric when you’re just starting out because it depends on so many factors (<a href="https://help.ahrefs.com/en/articles/1409408-what-is-domain-rating-dr">domain rating</a>, existing audience, brand strength, promotional process, industry size, and content saturation). But, as you start your content engine and consistently publish new, search-engine-optimized content, <strong>you should start seeing organic traffic gains within the first six to nine months</strong>. AI citation influence can begin much sooner (2-3 months) with properly structured content. Technical marketers should set expectations accordingly, anticipating slower direct traffic growth (due to AI Overviews intercepting informational queries) offset by increasing citation appearances.<br />
          Look for week-over-week growth in both metrics – traditional traffic and AI citation appearances – to measure comprehensive content performance.<br />
          In a separate asset published on Draft.dev called <a href="https://draft.dev/content-marketing-engine">“How to Set Up a Content Marketing Engine in the Age of AI”</a>, we'll discuss exactly what kind of content you should be creating and offer some tips for optimizing it, but for now, it’s important to get comfortable with Google Analytics so you can analyze your results over time.

      <h3 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 lg:text-3xl">Collecting Leads in Your Database</h3>
        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          New leads in your database per month.<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          Turn anonymous traffic into “known names” in your database.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          Users can opt-in to your database by entering their information in a form, and you can start building a relationship by contacting them regularly via email.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Attracting visitors to your content is obviously the first step, but these visitors will be anonymous unless you find a way to capture their contact information. Businesses rarely make money from anonymous traffic, so you need leads (“known names”) that you can create revenue from.<br />
          In the age of AI search, this becomes even more critical. When up to 60% of searches never reach your website, you must make the most of the traffic that does arrive. For technical audiences, this means creating higher-value conversion opportunities that are worth the extra click beyond what AI systems have already provided.
          One of the core responsibilities of content marketing is to turn “anonymous traffic” into “known names” in your database. Pageviews are nice, but you’ll want to care about <strong>unique humans</strong> that you can start building a relationship with. That means we need their email address and name.<br />
          For technical audiences, keep the value-to-friction ratio in mind. Technical professionals have high standards for content quality and are resistant to generic lead magnets. Create high quality lead magnets and developer-specific resources like code libraries, debugging tools, interactive sandboxes, configuration generators, or performance analyzers that deliver immediate utility beyond what AI systems can provide.<br />
          Identifying anonymous users will allow you to build a relationship with the people in your database by sending helpful, value-first emails to them on a recurring basis. As you build relationships with the humans in your database, you can reconnect with them frequently to make them aware of your products and move them through the buyer’s journey.
          But first, you need a way to collect these leads and attach a name and email address to each of them.
        </p>
        <h3>Set up a CRM like HubSpot or Mailchimp</h3>
        <p>
          Both <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="https://kit.com/">Kit</a> are good solutions for most small marketing teams just getting started. They are easy to set up, highly trusted, and cheap to get going with. Most importantly, they have all the features you’ll need to start building your Content Engine.<br />
          When marketing to technical audiences, consider additional capabilities that better serve developer-specific needs. Look for CRMs that support tagging by programming languages, technical specialties, or specific tech stack components. Technical audiences respond better to precisely targeted, relevant communications than to generic marketing messages.
          Of course, these are not the only viable solutions. We recommend Mailchimp or Kit when you are just getting started, but <strong>suggest HubSpot once you have more contacts to manage and the budget and team to support it</strong>. You can use a different service, but, for the upcoming examples, we'll walk through Mailchimp.
        </p>

        TODO: Implement Mailchimp_Dashboard pic Here
        <p className="text-sm italic">Mailchimp is a powerful, cost-effective service to start growing your lead database.</p>
        <h3>Create a newsletter signup form and welcome email</h3>
        <p>
          As a first step, we encourage you to create a <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/">signup form</a> and a <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-automated-welcome-email/">welcome email</a>.
          If you have some HTML and CSS skills, you can customize the email signup form. If not, just use Mailchimp’s <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/how-the-form-builder-works/">form builder</a> to create a signup form at the bottom of each blog post you publish. Use a <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/about-double-opt-in/">double opt-in</a> process to ensure high-quality leads.<br />
          For technical content marketing, implement contextual signup forms based on content topic. Developers reading Python content should see Python-specific offers, while those viewing cloud architecture content should receive cloud-focused incentives. These contextual offers can achieve 30-40% higher conversion rates than generic newsletter signups among technical audiences.<br />
          Finally, you could consider adding a <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-pop-up-signup-form-to-your-website/">pop-up signup form</a>. But be aware that this is very aggressive and intrusive. If you have a technical audience it is very likely this will hurt your brand. <strong>Your content’s primary goal should be building trust</strong>. Pop-ups might hurt your reputation more than they help in the long run.<br />
          This caution is especially important for technical audiences, who have even lower tolerance for interruptive marketing tactics. Instead, implement "value-trigger" conversion points – offering extended code examples, downloadable configurations, or interactive tools at natural breakpoints in technical content. These contextual offers convert 3-5x better than pop-ups with technical audiences while preserving trust.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Trade contact details for assets that provide value
        </h5>
        <p>
          Once your content engine is up and running, you should create a gated content asset to attract more signups to your email list. Such an asset is typically a downloadable piece of content with more depth than a typical blog post placed behind a signup form.<br />
          In the AI era, your gated content must deliver substantially more value than what AI systems already provide for free. <strong>For technical audiences, focus on creating assets with high implementation value</strong>: detailed architectural patterns, production-ready code libraries, benchmarking tools, security checklists, or interactive learning environments that solve specific developer problems. <br />
          If you don’t have such a piece yet, you can start by inviting readers to “join our weekly newsletter,” “get updates about new posts,” or “sign up for a free trial.” Put this call to action (CTA) at the bottom of each blog post.<br />
          For technical audiences specifically, create CTAs that speak to developer value propositions: "Get the complete code repository," "Access advanced implementation guides," or "Join our developer community." <strong>Avoid marketing language that sounds too promotional, as it tends to alienate technical professionals</strong>.<br />

        <h3 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 lg:text-3xl">Setting up Retargeting Audiences</h3>
        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          Retargeting audience size.<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          Retargeting helps increase brand awareness by serving ad impressions to previous blog visitors, and it increases repeat visits to your site.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          Advertising impressions to visitors that have previously engaged with your content.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Understanding how retargeting works</h4>
        <p>
          After you install a retargeting code snippet, new visitors are marked with a cookie whenever they read one of your blog posts. This cookie stays in the user’s browser for a certain amount of time, during which you can use retargeting to put advertisements in front of those visitors. Retargeting advertisements can appear on social media sites and any websites that are part of the Google Advertising Network.
        </p>
        <h4>Install the appropriate retargeting scripts</h4>
        <p>
          Depending on your target audience, install the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel">Meta</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2476688?hl=en">Google</a>, <a href="https://business.x.com/en/advertising">Twitter/X</a>, or <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ad-targeting/retargeting">LinkedIn</a> retargeting scripts on your blog. This code usually goes in the same place as your Google Analytics code does, but there’s very good documentation for implementing these snippets on each platform’s documentation page. If you opt to use Google Tag Manager, you can load your snippets from Tag Manager directly.
        </p>
        <h4>What about privacy?</h4>
        <p>
          According to GDPR regulations in Europe and the CCPA act in California, users must give consent to these retargeting cookies. We recommend cookie consent solutions like <a href="https://cookie-script.com/consent-mode-v2">Cookie Script</a> or <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/en/">Iubenda</a> for this. You can find a list of “Content Mode Partners” on <a href="https://cmppartnerprogram.withgoogle.com/">Google’s CMP Partner Program page</a>.<br />
          If you are not sure about the rules in your locale, be sure to check with a lawyer or experienced professional first.
        </p>
        <h4>What if you don’t have an advertising budget yet?</h4>
        <p>
          Even if you don’t run ads right away, it’s very powerful to have these tracking scripts in place ahead of time. That way, whenever you do decide to start advertising, you can turn it on and immediately start sending ad impressions to your cookied visitors, driving traffic to your landing page of choice.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 lg:text-3xl">Creating a Content Calendar</h3>
        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          Content pieces published per month.<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          Predictability comes from <i>acting</i>, not <i>reacting</i>. Content should be planned and created with intention.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          You know when new content will be published and you have a healthy backlog of content that is ready to publish.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Why you need a content calendar</h4>
        <p>
          As a content marketer, your goal is to create a steady stream of new content that leads to a predictable number of fresh leads in your database each month. You also need to be able to report your activities and plans to the business.<br />
          We recommend creating a content calendar that shows (planned) publishing dates in a simple calendar view. You can use <a href="https://trello.com/en-US">Trello</a> (with the <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210011/calendar">Calendar Power-Up</a>), <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a>, or a simple spreadsheet for it.
        </p>
        TODO: Add trello_content_calendar pic here
        <p>For your convenience, we have created a few ready-to-use content calendar templates. Whichever tool you prefer, these resources should be helpful to you:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://draft.dev/trello-content-calendar-template">Trello Content Calendar Template→</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://draft.dev/airtable-content-calendar-template">Airtable Content Calendar Template→</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://draft.dev/asana-content-calendar-template">Asana Content Calendar Template→</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Not every piece of content will be delivered on time, so your publishing dates can be somewhat fluid, especially at the beginning. That is okay, but over time, you’ll want to decrease the number of articles that are delivered (and published) late.<br />
          The goal is to create <strong>predictability</strong> in knowing “what is coming up.” This predictability allows you to plan ahead, orchestrate distribution waves to promote your content, be strategic about what you do with every piece, and transparently report your activities to the business.<br />
          A content calendar also dissuades you from the “inspiration strikes, let’s write and publish this article now!” approach. Rather, you will build up a healthy buffer of content that is ready to publish at predetermined times. One piece per week over the course of a month is better than four pieces in a week with nothing published the rest of the month.<br />
          Additionally, you could set up reminders for content refresh cycles. Technical content that ranks well or receives significant AI citations <strong>should be systematically updated</strong> every 90-120 days to maintain its relevance and authority. Establish a "living content" approach for your most valuable technical resources, treating them as products rather than one-time publications.
        </p>
        <h4>Create your calendar before you lock in topics</h4>
        <p>
          Even before you have your first topics ready, you can use your content calendar to put placeholders for each piece of content you want to produce in the upcoming year. If you’re starting with one piece of content every two weeks, you’ve got roughly 25 pieces to create over the next year. It doesn’t sound that bad when you think about it that way!
        </p>
        TODO: insert content_calendar_with_placeholders pic here
        <h4>Publish blog content at least once every two weeks</h4>
        <p>
          Having a consistent frequency helps set expectations with your readers and improves search engine performance. As you become more efficient with topic discovery and content production, your publishing cadence should increase.<br />
          Search algorithms and AI systems both <strong>prioritize regularly updated sources</strong>, and technical audiences expect continual evolution. However, with reduced direct traffic from informational queries, focus on higher-quality technical resources rather than high volume. For many technical B2B companies, 3-4 comprehensive technical resources per month (1200+ words) with proper code examples, visuals, and interactive elements outperform higher volumes of thinner content.<br />
          Should you and your team not have the capacity to publish an article every two weeks, start by creating multiple articles (which you won’t publish immediately), so you have enough at your disposal. This allows you to buy yourself the time to create more articles while the ones from your “content buffer” are being published.<br />
          Consider partnering with specialized technical content services like <a href="https://draft.dev">Draft.dev</a> that understand both the technical requirements and AI-era optimization needs. Technical content requires particular expertise, and the investment in high-quality, authoritative resources pays even greater dividends in the AI era where content quality is a primary factor in citation likelihood.<br />
          Once you know your team’s output capacity, look at your content calendar and start re-ordering the publishing dates of your placeholder slots. This will allow you to quickly see how many pieces you have in your content pipeline and exactly which ones will be published on which date. It might sound simple, but a content calendar is a very powerful tool.<br />
          <i>We have a dedicated eBook around which types of content to create and why in our <a href="https://draft.dev/resources">Resources section</a> on our Draft.dev website.

        <h4>An example of a content calendar in action</h4>
        <p>
          Let’s say you want to publish one article every other week or roughly two articles per month.<br />
          Right now, you only have the capacity to create one article per month, so you should wait to start publishing until you have at least six articles ready.<br />
          These six articles buy you three months of time, and in those three months, you can work on finding additional writers, be it internal or external contributors, that allow you to ramp up content production. This will allow you to reach your goal of publishing two articles per month consistently.<br />
          <strong>In short, try to figure out your current capacity and reverse engineer how many content pieces need to be produced in advance to allow for a content buffer</strong>. This gives you time to work on topic discovery and content production before your content buffer runs dry.

          Now that you know how to set up your Content Engine, learn how to build strategic content clusters around pillar content, nudge your readers down the funnel, and how to transform your expertise into valuable gated assets that convert visitors into leads.<br />
          Technical audiences demand content that demonstrates genuine expertise and addresses their specific challenges. Yet many companies struggle to create cohesive content strategies that both rank well and build credibility with developers and technical decision-makers.
        </p>
        <h3>Running Your Content Marketing Engine</h3>
        <p>
          You might be familiar with concepts like the content funnel, content mix, content types, and others. To keep things simple for now, here is the main goal we want to achieve when producing content in a systematic way:<br />
          In general, you should be producing two types of content:
          <ol>
            <li>Content focused on “evergreen” traffic, which <strong>ensures predictable traffic generation</strong> over time.</li>
            <li>Content focused on “spiky” traffic, which brings in <strong>a big spike of traffic</strong> during a short time frame to fill up your retargeting audience.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding the Content Funnel</h3>
        <p>
          The content funnel is a concept that can be used to understand the readiness and intent of a reader. It consists of multiple stages.
        </p>
        <h4>Top of the Content Funnel - Awareness</h4>
        <p>
          High up, in the <strong>top of the funnel</strong> we have readers that are “far away” from your product (in terms of intent). They have yet to become aware of your actual product, they might not even know yet that they are facing a problem that they’d want to resolve. This stage is called the <strong>Awareness</strong> stage.
        </p>
        <h4>Middle of the Content Funnel - Consideration</h4>
        <p>
          In the <strong>middle of the funnel</strong> your readers have started to understand the fundamentals around your space and product. They are realizing that they might have an inefficiency or a challenge within their business that should be resolved and that there are good ways to actually do that. They start considering the different ways, among those is your product/service. This stage is called the <strong>Consideration</strong> stage.
        </p>
        <h4>Bottom of the Content Funnel - Decision</h4>
        <p>
          In the <strong>bottom of the funnel</strong> readers realize that your product/service is the best solution to the challenges they are facing and they start to understand how to implement and use your product. This stage is called the <strong>Decision</strong> stage.<br />
          The logical next step after leaving the bottom of the content funnel is to either get in touch with your team about a demo/discovery call, or to give your product a try, which means the readers are then turning into users of your product starting their journey in the <strong>product funnel</strong>.
          <hr />
          <strong>In short:</strong> Early on when running your content engine, you want to raise awareness about your product offering. The best way to raise awareness is to produce high quality content, based on keyword research, for the top of the content funnel. This content will attract a wide array of people that don’t have high intent. Yet.<br />
          <strong>Yes, this still works in the age of AI Overviews and zero-click content.</strong> Certainly, a significant amount of traffic that previously would have gone to your website is now <strong>not</strong> arriving there due to AI Overviews on search engine results pages, or the search happening directly within an AI chatbot (or Google’s “AI Mode”). That being said, if you conduct your keyword research well and you adhere to on-page SEO best practices the explained approach will still drive consistent traffic to your website.<br />
          At the beginning, it’s about reeling in as many people as possible into your net. How to nudge them further down the funnel and how to monetize them is a challenge you will tackle later.<br />
          <strong>First things first:</strong> People need to become aware of your product offering. Over time, you will want to build content pieces that nudge people downwards the content funnel towards the product funnel. But, at the beginning you’ll want to have a predictable production of awareness-level content to drive consistent traffic from search engines to your blog.<br />
          In the following sections, we'll offer an overview of content funnel stages and the types of content, how and why you should utilize them, and how you can produce enough of each type of content to predictably generate new leads that drive your business forward.

        <h3 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 lg:text-3xl">Creating Evergreen Content</h3>
        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          Number of evergreen posts published per month.<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          Evergreen content that is optimized for search engines will drive consistent, focused traffic to your site. This allows you to generate more predictable traffic compared to spiky content.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          Predictable, high-converting traffic to your site.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>What is evergreen content?</h4>
        <p>
          Evergreen content is designed to rank highly on search engine results pages (SERPs) and being mentioned in AI Overviews and AI chatbots, thus attracting traffic over a long period of time. This content aims to be timeless, useful, search engine optimized, and regularly updated as information changes.<br />
        While spiky content (covered later) helps drive a lot of awareness in a short period of time, most of the traffic it generates is fleeting. Evergreen content doesn’t typically come out of the gate with a big bang, but traffic to each evergreen article grows over time as your site builds up domain authority and you get more backlinks.<br />
        <strong>Evergreen content will drive <i>significantly more focused and predictable traffic</i> for your business, so you should start investing in it early.</strong> As mentioned before, especially for evergreen content, consistency is key. I talk about how to stay consistent in your content production in my eBook <a href="https://draft.dev/content-marketing-engine">“How to Set Up a Content Marketing Engine in the Age of AI”</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Spiky vs. evergreen content</h4>
        <p>
          To see the effect of spiky vs. evergreen traffic, here’s a graph showing unique users visiting a blog. We can clearly see when articles were published that created traffic spikes:
        </p>

        TODO: insert Google_Analytics_traffic_spikes pic Here
        <p>
          There were a few spikes in the given time frame, but an especially successful one was created mid-August, with that article reaping in over 15,000 page views in one day, but as you can see, the traffic to this article quickly died off.<br />
          On the other hand, here’s a graph of a piece of evergreen content from our <a href="https://draft.dev/learn">Draft.dev blog</a> blog that was created with SEO best practices in mind:
        </p>

        TODO: insert Google_Analytics_evergreen_content_traffic pic Here
        <p>
          Ever since the article was published, its organic traffic has grown, and to this day it consistently brings in around 1,000 page views (between 600-800 unique visitors) per month.<br />
          Now imagine having 20, 50, or 100 such articles, and you can see how the numbers add up. A consistent traffic source to your blog is great for driving awareness for your business, but it also provides you with a <strong>predictable top of the funnel</strong>.<br />
          If you had 20 blog posts bringing in 200 unique visitors per week, that’s 16,000 unique visitors per month! These 16,000 visitors see your calls-to-action, and a subset will convert into deeper stages of the funnel.<br />
          The beauty of evergreen content is that <strong>once these blog posts are live and consistently generating organic traffic, you don’t need to spend a lot of money or time on them</strong>.<br />
          Of course, you’ll have to keep the articles up-to-date and refresh them every now and then. You will also consider spending time building backlinks, attracting social media traffic, and investing in other promotional tactics as this will help drive more traffic to your evergreen content.
        </p>
        <h4>Evergreen publishing frequency</h4>
        <p>
          <i>The value of each piece of evergreen content compounds over time as you add more content</i>, so you should be publishing it much more frequently than spiky content.<br />
          Early on, try to publish an evergreen article every two weeks, but increase that cadence to once per week (or more) if you can. Remember though, you need to maintain a buffer of content that’s ready to publish, have the capacity to work on more topic discovery, and have enough time to publish and promote each piece of content.<br />
          Here is a screenshot of the Trello content calendar shown in my eBook <a href="https://draft.dev/content-marketing-engine">“How to Set Up a Content Marketing Engine in the Age of AI”</a>:
        </p>

      <p>
        In this calendar, the team is prepared to publish three to four articles per week. Don’t expect to get to that kind of output early on - it takes time to build a buffer like this - but the predictability and peace of mind it provides are well worth it.

      <h4>Keeping evergreen content evergreen</h4>
      <p>
        Over time, even your best pieces of evergreen content will start to lose traffic. Usually, you can fix this by updating them when information becomes outdated or incorrect. Doing regular content audits of your existing content can help you identify articles that need to be refreshed, content interlinking opportunities available, and new gated assets that could be a good fit for a specific article.
      </p>
      <h4>Evergreen topic discovery</h4>
      <p>
        Creating evergreen content involves multiple stages of research: from content discovery via internal interviews, to community research, to keyword research that help you recognize topics that go well together, to defining specific content clusters.<br />
        Just like the other concepts mentioned in our <a href="https://draft.dev/resources">"eBooks and webinars"</a>, content discovery is a science, not an art. To discover suitable content ideas, look at keyword volume, keyword difficulty, content that competitors or other relevant players in your space published, and more.
      <h4>Creating content clusters</h4>
      <p>
        “Content clusters” are packages of articles that are produced in a specific way to help you achieve strong SERP (search engine results pages) placements for your most important keywords. They are composed of an “umbrella article” and multiple “sub-articles.”<br />
        Each of these evergreen articles can link to all other articles in the content cluster (the “sub-articles”), while your main piece (the “umbrella article”) will be the overview that links “down” to all other sub-articles. These, in turn, link back to the umbrella article.
      </p>

      TODO: insert evergreen_content_cluster pic Here
      <p>
        This system of intentionally interlinking articles helps readers discover more of your content and move further down the funnel. It also helps search and AI engines understand how content on your site is related and can help improve topical authority and can help boost each individual article’s rank on SERPs.
      </p>
      <h4>Production of evergreen content</h4>
      <p>
        Because evergreen content generally covers content higher up in the funnel it can often be outsourced to a third party. If you don’t have internal content contributors available or lack the specialized expertise to produce specific content, working with freelance writers or a content agency is a good option. <a href="https://draft.dev">Draft.dev</a> specifically specializes very narrowly on content for software developers, written by subject matter experts who are practicing software engineers in the industry. <br />
        Your team may want to cover certain key pieces, but many businesses lean on external production for the bulk of their evergreen content
      </p>
      <h4>Implementing basic Search Engine Optimization best-practices (helpful for SEO and GEO)</h4>
      <p>
        While search engine optimization (SEO) and generative engine optimization (GEO)/LLM search optimizationis another big topic, there are a few basics you should pay attention to when producing and publishing evergreen content:
        <ul>
          <li>Your post must not be too short. Very short articles (less than 500 words) are seen as “low-quality content” by Google and will typically not be ranked highly.</li>
          <li>Your main headline and sub-headlines should be keyword optimized.</li>
          <li>Your focus keyword should be mentioned in the first paragraph.</li>
          <li>Include an image in the first third of your article (here are some places for <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/free-stock-images">free stock photos for your blog</a>).</li>
          <li>Use “alt” tags on images to help search engines understand them.</li>
          <li>Make sure your article is readable (paragraph structure, emphasis, bold, headlines, etc.).</li>
          <li>Link to helpful, external resources that are not on your domain.</li>
          <li>Utilize meta-tags and schema markup that can help LLM and search engine crawlers better understand what your page is about.</li>
        </ul>
        By regularly publishing SEO-friendly content that follows EETA (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) principles, and following the above best practices, AI and search engines will start to see your site as a reliable source of information.

      <h4>Evergreen traffic brings readers with intent</h4>
      <p>
        Evergreen content is targeted to specific search terms, so when a visitor finds a piece of evergreen content, they are likely proactively searching for that topic. Such visitors are, therefore, more likely to be part of your target market than visitors drawn in from spiky posts.<br />
        Take the spiky traffic example from earlier. Is it possible that the business got some new customers out of the mid-August spike? Sure, it’s possible, but they probably get much higher conversion rates from users that use search terms specific to their product or problem space.<br />
        With evergreen content, your call to action can be much more direct. You can push readers to start a free trial, schedule a sales call, or download an ebook. Because these users are actively searching for something and your article answers that query, it is much easier to connect the content to the actual product or service you are selling. I will be talking more about steering your readers through the content funnel and nudging them further “down” towards your product in the next section.
      </p>
      <h4>Evergreen content helps you manage your funnel</h4>
      <p>
        Evergreen content also helps you manage your content funnel and content mix better than spiky content.<br />
        When starting with content creation, you might focus on producing <strong>awareness-level evergreen content</strong> that brings people into the <strong>top of your content funnel</strong>. Let’s assume you are working for a business in the data warehouse space. Your awareness-level articles will likely be high-level overviews and definitions of key industry terms like:
        <ul>
          <li>“What are the different types and benefits of data integrations”</li>
        </ul>
        In the era of AI,  searchers will likely consume too basic top-funnel search queries directly in the AI overview or within the chatbot results. So try to find a good mix of “generally interesting” topics for your audience that are not too basic that a simple AI overview delivers all the information the reader needs. 
        For example, instead of <i>“What are system integrations?”</i> we pick the above <i>“What are the different types and benefits of data integrations”</i>. This is not as vague, and also written exactly like a search query in an AI chatbot might be written. In this article, you could write about ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Reverse ETL, ELT (Extract, Load, Transform), streaming, application integration, and more, covering many important keywords.
        Next, you might focus on <strong>consideration-level evergreen content</strong>. This type of content represents the <strong>middle of your content funnel</strong> and can be described as content that makes your readers realize they actually might have a problem they were not aware of that warrants solving. This could be content like:
        <ul>
          <li>“How data warehouses help you run your business more efficiently”</li>
          <li>“How connecting information from different data sources helps you understand your users better”</li>
        </ul>      
        Last, you could focus on longer-tail keywords by writing <strong>decision-level evergreen content</strong>. These pieces will help guide customers who are already aware of the problem and have decided they’d like to resolve it, so they represent the <strong>bottom of your content funnel</strong>. Examples might include:
        <ul>
          <li>“How to integrate Salesforce with [our product]”</li>
          <li>“Setting up your first data pipeline using [our product]”</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      TODO: insert content_funnel_stages pic Here
      <p>
        When looking at these three stages, you might realize that generating a significant volume of traffic is harder the deeper you are into the content funnel. Getting lots of readers for awareness pieces is easier because the content covered is more “generic” - the topics relate to a multitude of audiences - but the more specific our content gets, the fewer people are searching for it.<br />
        This is why having a good content mix is key. You should regularly monitor the performance of your content (especially traffic and time on page) in its respective funnel stages by running content audits to identify “gaps” in your funnel. This also means you need to be able to define where each piece you publish falls in the content funnel.
      </p>
      <h4>Analyze your created content and your content mix</h4>
      <p>
        Let’s revisit the example of the data warehouse company mentioned earlier. After auditing your published content and seeing where it fits in the buyer’s journey, you might realize that you are lacking content aimed at the <i>consideration</i> phase (the middle of the funnel).
        You brainstorm a few ideas that fit into that stage, run keyword research, define headlines for a few articles, and start producing and optimizing these pieces for your target keywords. This leads you to create middle-of-funnel content like:
        <ul>
          <li>“Why your traditional data warehouse is not good enough anymore”</li>
          <li>“Why Reverse ETL is taking over”</li>
        </ul>
        You publish these pieces, and now you have a way to move customers through the <i>consideration</i> phase of the funnel.<br />
        This process works, even with completely anonymous visitors, because you know that a reader has “dropped into your funnel” at a specific stage with a specific intent in mind. They entered a search term into their search engine of choice and ended up on one of your blog posts. You know which stage of the funnel that blog post is in, you have other relevant content pieces that you link to from it (ideally pushing the reader further down the funnel), and you can use those pieces to teach users about your product and eventually help them convert into a paying user.<br />
        As mentioned earlier, creating a content engine is a science, not an art. Each piece of content you create should be aimed at a specific stage in the funnel. You have the power to orchestrate the journey your readers take and meet them with links to other content pieces and the best calls to action (CTAs).<br />
        Creating evergreen content helps you maintain consistent output, establish your authority around a set of specific keywords, and gives you a collection of articles that can be transformed into your first gated asset. This process of content audit, keyword research, strategic content creation, internal backlinks, and intentional CTAs allows you to create a predictable content engine for your business.

        <h4>The What, Why, And Desired Result</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Metric:</strong>
          Number of spiky posts published per quarter, spikes created per quarter.<br />
          <strong>Why it Matters:</strong>
          Spiky content will drive a high number of new unique visitors to your site in a very short time frame. Use these traffic spikes to serve retargeting ad impressions to visitors.<br />
          <strong>Final Result:</strong>
          Higher brand awareness, a refilled retargeting audience, and new organic backlinks.

        <h4>What is spiky content?</h4>
        <p>
          “Spiky” content is designed to be widely shared or go “viral.”<br />
          The goal is that a certain percentage of spiky posts will be picked up on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit, Facebook Groups, Hacker News, Lobste.rs, industry newsletters, or whatever channel is most appropriate for your audience.
          We call these channels <i>multiplicators</i>. Multiplicators are channels that you can tap into to get your content in front of a much larger audience. These channels consistently work on increasing their audience reach as it is part of their business model.<br />
          Let’s take an industry newsletter as an example. Most newsletter businesses rely on selling sponsorship slots or ads within their newsletters to advertisers who are looking to reach a very targeted audience. The more subscribers the newsletter has, the greater the reach for potential advertisers and the more expensive the sponsorship slot.<br />
          As you might imagine, it’s in the newsletter curator’s best interest to increase their subscriber count (audience size), so most do this by consistently serving high-quality content to their subscribers.<br />
          Of course, you can buy sponsorship slots in a newsletter (for example, you can link to gated assets to obtain a “direct route” to turning someone into a “known name” in your database), but you can also try getting some of your blog posts <strong>organically placed</strong> in their newsletter. Assuming your content is relevant, interesting, and well-written, the newsletter curator might include it organically.<br />
          When this happens, you might get a huge boost in traffic for a short period of time after the newsletter shares your piece. This traffic spike is the goal of your spiky content.
