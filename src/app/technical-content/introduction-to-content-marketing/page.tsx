      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">
        The impact of AI Overviews and zero-click content
      </h3>
      <p>
        Content marketing has proven time and time again that it can be a
        valuable revenue driver for businesses, regardless of industry. While
        many businesses know the value of content marketing, they struggle to
        turn content into a consistent, predictable growth channel. All too
        often, they start a blog, create a few posts, then lose steam. The
        marketing team looks back at their Analytics account a few weeks later
        and sees almost nothing, so they move on to other channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        This challenge is magnified in the AI era, where Google&apos;s AI
        Overviews and other AI search features now intercept up to 60% or more
        of search traffic through zero-click results. For technical content
        marketing, this impact is even greater, with informational queries
        seeing up to a 34.5% drop in click-through rates when AI Overviews
        appear. Despite these challenges, content marketing remains essential—it
        simply requires adaptation to this new reality.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 text-zinc-600">
        Why content marketing still matters
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Marketers who fail to succeed at content marketing usually either lack
          the processes, systems, and frameworks needed, or they lack the
          discipline to carry out those processes consistently.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we walk you through the pre-requisites and goals of building an
        effective content marketing engine for technical audiences: The tech
        stack, strategy, and a tried and trusted framework to help you reverse
        engineer your production and publishing plan. We also address the
        specific challenges of creating technical content in an era where AI
        systems increasingly mediate the relationship between your content and
        your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then will teach you about the content funnel, different funnel stages
        and their purposes, and how to create a productive content mix.
      </p>
      <p>
        We walk through the prerequisites of building a strong content marketing
        engine. We walk through what to measure, how to measure it, and why, as
        well as explaining how we want to attract awareness, capture traffic,
        and turn it into leads. It provides helpful foundational knowledge for
        everything you learn in this book. At the end of this guide you&apos;ll
        know how to create interconnected content systems that establish
        authority, drive organic traffic, and generate qualified leads from
        technical audiences.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 text-zinc-600">Core principles for AI-era content</h3>
      <p>
        In today&apos;s AI-dominated landscape, our responsibility extends
        beyond driving website traffic. Technical B2B marketers must now
        optimize for &quot;content influence&quot; – ensuring our expertise is
        recognized and cited by AI systems that increasingly mediate how
        developers and technical professionals discover information. This
        requires intentional optimization for both traditional search and
        emerging AI discovery patterns.

        Content Marketing Needs to Drive Revenue
      </Heading>

      <p>
        As content marketers, we have a responsibility to the business to
        provide predictable output of content that drives people from awareness
        to consideration to purchase decision. We also have a duty to analyze
        and report on what we do and why we do it, and to learn and revise our
        actions based on these insights. Marketing in general, but{' '}
        <strong>
          content marketing specifically, is not an art; it&apos;s a
        </strong>{' '}
        <strong>science</strong>. It takes robust systems, processes, and
        discipline to execute.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 text-zinc-600">Key metrics and goals</h3>
      <p>
        A &quot;content marketing engine&quot; is a repeatable system for
        creating, publishing, and promoting content designed to reach and
        convert your target customers. Each piece of content is aimed at a
        specific stage of the marketing funnel (awareness, consideration,
        decision) and should lead to predictable and measurable results for your
        business. The desired results are typically traffic generation and new
        leads added to your database.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the AI era, our responsibility extends beyond driving website
        traffic. Technical B2B marketers must now optimize for &quot;content
        influence&quot;, ensuring our expertise is recognized and cited by AI
        systems that increasingly decide how developers and technical
        professionals discover information. This requires intentional
        optimization for both traditional search and emerging AI discovery
        patterns. The results of our work now must include AI Overview
        appearances, brand citation rates, and technical authority metrics that
        measure how frequently our content is referenced by AI systems.
        What&apos;s changed is not the fundamental value of content marketing,
        but how we adapt our approach for an environment where AI systems now
        mediate information discovery and consumption.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 text-zinc-600">
        The science vs. art of content marketing
      </h3>
      <p>
        This guide will walk you through the exact process that you can use to
        set up a predictable, consistent content engine that provides you with
        insights and data to{' '}
        <strong>prove its effectiveness to business leadership</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this guide, we&apos;ll focus on written content in the form of blog
        posts as the primary medium for your content engine. While you
        don&apos;t have to limit your content engine to written content, writing
        is often the best place to start. Blog posts can be easily repurposed
        into downloadable PDFs, conversations for a podcast, or talks for a
        conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical content particularly benefits from this approach, as code
        examples, technical documentation, and implementation guides{' '}
        <strong>
          can be strategically structured to maintain value in both
          AI-summarized and full-length formats
        </strong>
        .
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 text-zinc-600">
        Aligning content with business objectives
      </h3>
      <p>
        We know this strategy works because we&apos;ve used it for years,
        implementing it for companies of all sizes. Whether you&apos;re a
        one-person marketing team with less than $1 million in annual revenue or
        part of a multi-million-dollar software company, follow along with this
        guide to create a repeatable, scalable, and predictable content
        marketing engine!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following sections, we&apos;ll show you how to set up a
        predictable and scalable content marketing framework - step by step.
        We&apos;ll start with setting up a{' '}
        <strong>“content marketing engine”</strong>, a repeatable system for
        creating, publishing, and promoting content designed to reach and
        convert your target customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each piece of content is aimed at a specific stage of the marketing
        funnel (awareness, consideration, decision) and should lead to
        predictable and measurable results for your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s start with setting up core pre-requisites like your content
        management system and analytics tracking. Next, we&apos;ll show you how
        to turn anonymous traffic into known leads that you store in your
        database and increase brand awareness using retargeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we&apos;ll show you how to set up and use a content calendar to
        ensure that your content engine is consistent and predictable.
