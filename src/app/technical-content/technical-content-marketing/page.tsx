        They make it easy to publish new content, add code snippets (like
        retargeting and analytics), update your stylesheets, and customize
        everything about your site. For technical content marketing in the AI
        era, these systems offer additional advantages: they allow more granular
        control over content structure, metadata, and schema markup â€“ all
        critical factors in how AI systems process your content. Implementing
        proper heading hierarchies, structured data for code samples, and clear
        technical documentation patterns improves how AI systems parse and cite
        your expertise.

        Additionally, this architecture makes it easier to implement AI-readable
        content structures, including explicit answer sections, FAQ schema, and
        table-based information that AI systems can effectively extract and
        cite.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">
        Blog architecture (subdomain vs. subdirectory)
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>What if I already have a blog set up on my domain?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don&apos;t reinvent the wheel. If your CMS works for you and it performs
        well, there&apos;s no need to spend a month migrating to a static site.
        Website migrations can be very delicate, so consult with your
        engineering team or an external specialist before you start this
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, on the other hand, your CMS is restricting the amount of content you
        can produce or its poor performance is hurting your ability to rank well
        in search engines, you should move off it as soon as possible. In the AI
        era, <strong>technical content needs particular attention</strong> to
        structure and machine readability. If your current CMS limits your
        ability to implement structured data, create properly nested heading
        hierarchies, or control the semantics of your HTML, consider
        prioritizing migration. These technical elements significantly impact
        how AI systems process and cite your content, potentially affecting 60%
        of your potential audience who now consume content through AI
        interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        One decision you will face then is whether you&apos;d like your blog to
        be located on a subdirectory (/blog) or on a subdomain
        (blog.yourdomain.com). There are different viable approaches, depending
        on the role your blog plays for your business. But, if you&apos;d like
        to implement the systems taught throughout our Draft.dev resources, our{' '}
        <strong>clear recommendation</strong> is to have your blog located in a
        subdirectory on your top-level-domain. The reason being that, over time,
        your published blog content will receive backlinks from external sources
        and we&apos;d rather have them benefit our top-level-domain than a
        subdomain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Search Engines &quot;see&quot; subdomains as separate entities. So, if
        we&apos;d receive a lot of backlinks to our subdomain, we&apos;d then
        have to generate a lot of backlinks to our top-level-domain{' '}
        <strong>from our blog subdomain</strong>. Which means we&apos;d have to
        link to our &quot;main website&quot; as often as possible from our own
        blog. Which, depending on the type of content we have published, can
        make sense in a lot of cases, but won&apos;t make sense 100% of the time
        and might be perceived as very pushy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This subdirectory approach becomes even more important in the AI era
        where domain authority and topical authority influence how AI systems
        evaluate the credibility of your content. By keeping technical content
        on your main domain, you consolidate authority signals that help both
        traditional SEO and AI citation metrics.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">
        Publishing on third-party platforms
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>What about publishing on Medium, Dev.to or LinkedIn?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Publishing your blog posts exclusively to a third-party platform like
        Medium, Dev.to, or LinkedIn is tempting because it&apos;s easy, and they
        offer a built-in distribution network. In the age of AI Overviews and
        zero-click content consumption it&apos;s also a good approach to
        establish a multi-platform presence as to not having to solely rely on
        your website for brand awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          That said, especially at the beginning of your content marketing
          journey it is not a good idea as they won&apos;t help your primary
          top-level-domain&apos;s ranking in search engines.
        </strong>{' '}
        Links on these platforms are usually &quot;
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links"
          target="_blank"

        >
          no-follow links
        </a>
        ,&quot; so they won&apos;t pass much value to other resources or landing
        pages you reference from them. Once you have your content engine
        running, you can use publishing on these platforms as opportunities to
        syndicate optimized versions with canonical links back to your site.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already have content on these platforms, we recommend migrating
        it to your new blog and updating existing platform content with{' '}
        <strong>canonical links pointing to your domain version</strong> and to
        restructure it to serve as a &quot;preview&quot; that drives users to
        the complete resource on your site.

        While Google Analytics remains essential, it&apos;s now insufficient for

        Tracking unique visitors in the AI era
      </h3>
      <p>
        Over time, you obviously want the number of unique visitors to your site
        to rise. When you publish and promote a new piece of content,
        you&apos;ll likely see a spike in traffic from social media and
        newsletters, but &quot;organic&quot; search engine traffic from specific
        keyword searches will drive much more traffic in the long term. In
        Google Analytics, you will want to keep track of the &quot;Active
        Users&quot; metric to get an overview of how many unique visitors were
        visiting your site.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the AI era, you can focus on segmenting your traffic analysis to
        distinguish between different types of visitors. Particularly for
        technical content, track developer-specific metrics like code sample
        usage, documentation page depth, API interaction, GitHub referrals, and
        repeat visitor patterns. These signals help identify high-intent
        technical visitors despite lower overall traffic volumes.

          you should start seeing organic traffic gains within the first six to
          nine months
        </strong>
        . AI citation influence can begin much sooner (2-3 months) with properly
        structured content. Technical marketers should set expectations
        accordingly, anticipating slower direct traffic growth (due to AI
        Overviews intercepting informational queries) offset by increasing
        citation appearances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look for week-over-week growth in both metrics â€“ traditional traffic and
        AI citation appearances â€“ to measure comprehensive content performance.

        What&apos;s changed is not the fundamental value of content marketing,

      <p>
        Attracting visitors to your content is obviously the first step, but
        these visitors will be anonymous unless you find a way to capture their
        contact information. Businesses rarely make money from anonymous
        traffic, so you need leads (&quot;known names&quot;) that you can create
        revenue from.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the age of AI search, this becomes even more critical. When up to 60%
        of searches never reach your website, you must make the most of the
        traffic that does arrive. For technical audiences, this means creating
        higher-value conversion opportunities that are worth the extra click
        beyond what AI systems have already provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the core responsibilities of content marketing is to turn
        &quot;anonymous traffic&quot; into &quot;known names&quot; in your

        Mailchimp is a powerful, cost-effective service to start growing your

        When marketing to technical audiences, consider additional capabilities
        that better serve developer-specific needs. Look for CRMs that support
        tagging by programming languages, technical specialties, or specific
        tech stack components. Technical audiences respond better to precisely
        targeted, relevant communications than to generic marketing messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, these are not the only viable solutions. We recommend
        Mailchimp or Kit when you are just getting started, but{' '}
        <strong>
          suggest HubSpot once you have more contacts to manage and the budget
          and team to support it.

        You can use a different service, but, for the upcoming examples,

        Creating newsletter signup forms and welcome emails

          welcome email

        . If you have some HTML and CSS skills, you can customize the email
        signup form. If not, just use Mailchimp&apos;s{' '}

        to create a signup form at the bottom of each blog post you publish. Use
        a{' '}

        </a>{' '}
        process to ensure high-quality leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        For technical content marketing, implement contextual signup forms based
        on content topic. Developers reading Python content should see
        Python-specific offers, while those viewing cloud architecture content
        should receive cloud-focused incentives. These contextual offers can
        achieve 30-40% higher conversion rates than generic newsletter signups
        among technical audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, you could consider adding a{' '}
        <a
          href="https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-pop-up-signup-form-to-your-website/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          pop-up signup form
        </a>
        . But be aware that this is very aggressive and intrusive. If you have a
        technical audience it is very likely this will hurt your brand.{' '}
        <strong>
          Your content&apos;s primary goal should be building trust. Pop-ups
          might hurt your reputation more than they help in the long run.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This caution is especially important for technical audiences, who have
        even lower tolerance for interruptive marketing tactics. Instead,
        implement &quot;value-trigger&quot; conversion points â€“ offering
        extended code examples, downloadable configurations, or interactive
        tools at natural breakpoints in technical content. These contextual
        offers convert 3-5x better than pop-ups with technical audiences while
        preserving trust.

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">
        Trading high value assets for contact details
      </h3>
      <p>
        Once your content engine is up and running, you should create a gated
        content asset to attract more signups to your email list. Such an asset
        is typically a downloadable piece of content with more depth than a
        typical blog post placed behind a signup form.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the AI era, your gated content must deliver substantially more value
        than what AI systems already provide for free.
        <strong>
          {' '}
          For technical audiences, focus on creating assets with high
          implementation value
        </strong>
        : detailed architectural patterns, production-ready code libraries,
        benchmarking tools, security checklists, or interactive learning
        environments that solve specific developer problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don&apos;t have such a piece yet, you can start by inviting
        readers to &quot;join our weekly newsletter,&quot; &quot;get updates
        about new posts,&quot; or &quot;sign up for a free trial.&quot; Put this
        call to action (CTA) at the bottom of each blog post.
      </p>
      <p>
        For technical audiences specifically, create CTAs that speak to
        developer value propositions: &quot;Get the complete code
        repository,&quot; &quot;Access advanced implementation guides,&quot; or
        &quot;Join our developer community.&quot;{' '}
        <strong>Avoid marketing language that sounds too promotional</strong>,
        as it tends to alienate technical professionals.

        Retargeting helps increase brand awareness by serving ad impressions to

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">How does retargeting for ads work?</h3>
      <p>
        After you install a retargeting code snippet, new visitors are marked
        with a cookie whenever they read one of your blog posts. This cookie
        stays in the user&apos;s browser for a certain amount of time, during
        which you can use retargeting to put advertisements in front of those
        visitors. Retargeting advertisements can appear on social media sites
        and any websites that are part of the Google Advertising Network.

        start sending ad impressions to your cookied visitors, driving traffic
        to your landing page of choice.
