      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">Why do I need a content calendar?</h3>
      <p>
        As a content marketer, your goal is to create a steady stream of new
        content that leads to a predictable number of fresh leads in your
        database each month. You also need to be able to report your activities
        and plans to the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend creating a content calendar that shows (planned) publishing
        dates in a simple calendar view. You can use{' '}

        (with the{' '}

          href="https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d917446f517774210011/calendar"

        , or a simple spreadsheet for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every piece of content will be delivered on time, so your publishing
        dates can be somewhat fluid, especially at the beginning. That is okay,
        but over time, you&apos;ll want to decrease the number of articles that
        are delivered (and published) late.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to create <strong>predictability</strong> in knowing
        &quot;what is coming up.&quot; This predictability allows you to plan
        ahead, orchestrate distribution waves to promote your content, be
        strategic about what you do with every piece, and transparently report
        your activities to the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        A content calendar also dissuades you from the &quot;inspiration
        strikes, let&apos;s write and publish this article now!&quot; approach.
        Rather, you will build up a healthy buffer of content that is ready to
        publish at predetermined times. One piece per week over the course of a
        month is better than four pieces in a week with nothing published the
        rest of the month.

        Frequently update content to stay relevant

        <mark>
          <strong>
            Technical content that ranks well or receives significant AI
            citations should be systematically updated every 90-120 days
          </strong>
        </mark>{' '}
        to maintain its relevance and authority. Establish a &quot;living
        content&quot; approach for your most valuable technical resources,
        treating them as products rather than one-time publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, you can fix these articles by updating them when information
        becomes outdated or incorrect. Doing regular content audits of your
        existing content can help you identify articles that need to be
        refreshed, content interlinking opportunities available, and new gated
        assets that could be a good fit for a specific article.
      </p>

      <Heading id="building-your-technical-content-calendar">
        Building Your Technical Content Calendar
      </Heading>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">Creating before locking topics</h3>
      <p>
        Even before you have your first topics ready, you can use your content
        calendar to put placeholders for each piece of content you want to
        produce in the upcoming year. If you&apos;re starting with one piece of
        content every two weeks, you&apos;ve got roughly 25 pieces to create
        over the next year. It doesn&apos;t sound that bad when you think about
        it that way!
      </p>
      <p>
        In this calendar, the team is prepared to publish three to four articles
        per week. Don&apos;t expect to get to that kind of output early on - it
        takes time to build a buffer like this - but the predictability and
        peace of mind it provides are well worth it.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">Publishing frequency guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        Having a consistent frequency helps set expectations with your readers
        and improves search engine performance. As you become more efficient
        with topic discovery and content production, your publishing cadence
        should increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Search algorithms and AI systems both{' '}
        <strong>prioritize regularly updated sources</strong>, and technical
        audiences expect continual evolution. However, with reduced direct
        traffic from informational queries, focus on higher-quality technical
        resources rather than high volume. For many technical B2B companies, 3-4
        comprehensive technical resources per month (1200+ words) with proper
        code examples, visuals, and interactive elements outperform higher
        volumes of thinner content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should you and your team not have the capacity to publish an article
        every two weeks, start by creating multiple articles (which you
        won&apos;t publish immediately), so you have enough at your disposal.
        This allows you to buy yourself the time to create more articles while
        the ones from your &quot;content buffer&quot; are being published.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider partnering with specialized technical content services like{' '}
        <a href="https://draft.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Draft.dev
        </a>{' '}
        that understand both the technical requirements and AI-era optimization
        needs. Technical content requires particular expertise, and the
        investment in high-quality, authoritative resources pays even greater
        dividends in the AI era where content quality is a primary factor in
        citation likelihood.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">Buffer management strategies</h3>
      <p>
        Once you know your team&apos;s output capacity, look at your content
        calendar and start re-ordering the publishing dates of your placeholder
        slots. This will allow you to quickly see how many pieces you have in
        your content pipeline and exactly which ones will be published on which
        date. It might sound simple, but a content calendar is a very powerful
        tool.

        Content Calendar in Action
      </Heading>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">Real-world examples</h3>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s say you want to publish one article every other week or
        roughly two articles per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, you only have the capacity to create one article per month,
        so you should wait to start publishing until you have at least six
        articles ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        These six articles buy you three months of time, and in those three
        months, you can work on finding additional writers, be it internal or
        external contributors, that allow you to ramp up content production.
        This will allow you to reach your goal of publishing two articles per
        month consistently.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-6 text-zinc-600">Capacity planning</h3>

        to allow for a content buffer. This gives you time to work on topic
        discovery and content production before your content buffer runs dry.
